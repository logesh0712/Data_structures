Steps to become pro:
___________________
	Go through below data structure concepts. 
  Its okay to skip some advance concepts initially.
	try to work out some easy and basic problems in paper first and bring your production level coding standard in flow.
	Then go to some sites like interview bit, leetcode ..etc to start practising.
	FYI --> There is no one like pro :)
 
Data structures: (Most common and good problems to start on each concept is below)
________________
	Arrays 

	Stacks 

	Queues 

	Sets 

	Maps 

	Linked list 

	Binary trees 

	Heaps 

	Graphs (Advance) --> Start with breath and depth first traversal

 

Algorithms: 
___________
	Sorting, Searching, Binary search 

	Recursion 

	Graph traversals, Breadth & depth first 

	Dynamic programming and memorization (Advance)
		its little hard at beginning. must needed one.
		This is tushar youtube videos: He would have given good lectures on most of the problem.
		when you are stuck on any problems, checkout whether he solved it in his videos.

	Divide and conquer (Advance)

	Greedy Algorithms (Advance)
