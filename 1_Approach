How to approach data structure problems: 
_________________________________________
	1.Communication & requirement gathering (Think out load and get clarity on the problem) 
		some problems looks like very simple. but you have no idea what customer/interviewer have in mind.
		so spend some time here. look for below example
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw 
    In some cases if you are not getting the requirement, go to step 4 and then come back to here.
    
	2.Data structures & Algorithm (start from simple solution & optimize) --> this is the good way. no body cannot give optimised on first shot.
		Start with simple solution - find out time complexity.
		Then think of better way - find out time complexity and compare the solutions you have in hand.
		Finalize the solution and then go to coding
    
	3.Coding 
		The goal here is you need to have a good production level code.
		So when starting to practise start with writing pseudo code.
		Try to convert pseudo code to production code in paper workouts.
		
		practise:
		_________
		compare code with good codes online for the problems you solved.
		By practise you will come to know below stuffs
        Names:
          where to declare variables
          what variable names to use (use meaninful always) 
          what function name to use (your function name should tell your task inside your function)
        
        Code:
          How to break down to sub tasks and reuse code. 
          how to write util methods. (Always get necessary inputs for your function from user and write down util methods with your own extra inputs)
    			where to check the conditions
          boundary conditions
          where to write comments...etc

	4.Boundary conditions, test case and error checking 
		Think about different input which can break your code.
		In some cases if you are not getting the requirements, apply this steps on requirement and gathering itself to understand the problem better.
		if you are using recursive methods, think on conditions when you will come out of the loop.
